# Image-Tracking
1. Built an object tracking model using YOLO, DeepSORT and Tensorflow.
2. Used YOLO to perform object detection and then passed its output to DeepSORT to facilitate object tracking. 
3. Used pre-trained weights of the model trained on [MS COCO dataset](https://cocodataset.org/#home).
4. Tech stack used was Tensorflow, YOLO, DeepSORT, OpenCV, Numpy, Pandas, Python.
